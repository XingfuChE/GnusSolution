This repo demonstrate one **complete** and **working** solution to reading/writing mails in Gnus, with the help of `offlineimap`, `dovecot`, `msmtp` and `cron`. Concretely, this repo contains

1.  necessary configuration files for each component,
2.  a brief summary of the big picture and detailed explanation on how the components work together, and
3.  helpful resource links.

*Note: The conf is tested under Ubuntu, it should work fine for all Linux distributions provided each component be properly installed.*

# Requirements

1.  Basic knowledge of Linux environment
2.  Comfortable with command line.
3.  Good knowledge of `emacs` and `gnus`.


<a id="sec:how-to-use"></a>

# How to Use

Make sure all dependencies are installed properly and stop `dovecot` service if it is running in background.

1.  *Edit* and copy `msmtprc`, `netrc` and `offlineimaprc` to `~/.msmtprc`, `~/.netrc` and `~/.offineimaprc`. Note that `.netrc` need to be set to mode `600`, otherwise `msmtp` may complain.
2.  Edit `10-mail.conf` (detailed below).
3.  Invoke `offlineimap` manually. Sit back and have a cup of coffee, it will takes quite some time to download all the mails for the first time. Once finished, you should be able to see a similar folder structure.

        ~/Mail/
        ├── archive
        ├── cur
        ├── drafts
        ├── Gmail
        │   ├── archive
        │   │   ├── cur
        │   │   ├── new
        │   │   └── tmp
        │   ├── flagged
        │   │   ├── cur
        │   │   ├── new

        │   ├── important
        │   │   ├── cur
        │   │   ├── new
        │   │   └── tmp
        │   ├── inbox
        │   │   ├── cur
        │   │   ├── new
        │   │   └── tmp
        │   ├── sent
        │   │   ├── cur
        │   │   ├── new
        │   │   └── tmp
        │   └── trash
        │       ├── cur
        │       ├── new
        │       └── tmp
        ├── new
        └── tmp

4.  Start `dovecot` by `sudo service dovecot start`.
5.  Register the `cron` job by `crontab cron-jobs`.
6.  Open `emacs` and fire up `gnus`. And that's it!

# The Big Picture

This section gives a brief summary of what each component does, and does not if necessary.

-   **offlineimap:** It does mainly two things:

    1.  retrive mail from server to local folder, and
    2.  sync flags on local mails to server. For example, when you finish reading a mail in `gnus`, the mail is marked as *read*; `offlineimap` will sync this *read* flag to the server to make sure that the mail on the server is also marked as *read*.

    It does **NOT** do two things,

    1.  send mails, which is done by `msmtp`;
    2.  invoke itself, which is done by `cron`.

-   **msmtp:** It sends mails. It will be automatically invoked by `gnus`. You never need to manually start the program yourself. Actually most of the time you are not even aware of its existence.

-   **dovecot:** It serves mails. `dovecot` is a simple yet powerful mail server. Wait, why do we ever need a local server? `offlineimap` already downloads all the mails to local folders, and `gnus` *can* directly read local folders, why bother with another mail server? Because `gnus` sometimes messes up the IMAP mails. `gnus` is known to have problems properly handling flags, e.g., *read*, on mails. Instead of using *gnus* to directly messing up with mail, we use a delicate mail server, `dovecot` to interact with mails professionally. In this case, `gnus` only tells `dovecot` what it wants to do and `dovecot` does it accordingly. For example, when finishing reading a mail in `gnus`, `gnus` notifies `dovecot` that this mail should be marked as *read*, `dovecot` does it accordingly. And as you already know it, this *read* flag with be synced by `offlineimap`.

-   **cron:** Invoke \`offlineimap\` periodically. `offlineimap` does not run by itself magically, we need to invoke `offlineimap` periodically to sync between local and remote. You may also invoke `offlineimap` manually if that's how want it LOL.

-   **gnus:** You read/write/reply/&#x2026; mails in it. Basically it is a interface where you interact with mails. Although `gnus` can actually finished all aforementioned jobs by itself (woooof), I decide to use professional utilities to handle what it is best at.

-   **netrc:** The \`netrc\` file stores the password. It has to be set to mode \`600\` (read/write by current login user only) to work properly.

# Devil in the detail

This section explains in detail configuration of each component. Note that there are many possible working configurations available, what's outlined here is just one of them (as a result of my years of frustration).


<a id="subsec:offlineimap"></a>

## offlineimap

Full configuration in <offlineimaprc>.

The configuration is minimum yet fully functional. Most of the configuration are self-evident except for, perhaps, the `nametrans`.

According to the official [document on `nametrans`](http://www.offlineimap.org/doc/versions/v6.5.6/nametrans.html#nametrans), it allows you to have different folder name other than the names on the remote server. For example, when login in Gmail, you will see folders <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>, e.g., `Sent Mail` for sent mails, `Trash` for deleted mails, etc. Different mail server may name these folders differently. If you want a unified names locally, you can use `nametrans` features to map a remote folder to the local folder with a different name, e.g., `sent` for sent mails that syncs with `Sent Mail`, `trash` for deleted mails that syncs with `Trash`, etc.

In my configuration, `nametrans` takes a Python function, with sole parameter `folder`, i.e., the remote folder name in string.

`folderfilter` controls which folders to sync. Please refer to [document on `folderfilter`](http://www.offlineimap.org/doc/versions/v6.5.6/nametrans.html#folderfilter) for more details.


<a id="subsec:msmtp"></a>

## msmtp

Full configuration in <msmtprc>.

The configuration is just standard. I copied the configuration from online.


<a id="subsec:dovecot"></a>

## dovecot

Full <sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> configuration in <10-mail.conf>.

There is only one change made in `10-mail.conf` which usually resides in `/etc/dovecot/conf.d/`.


<a id="subsec:cron"></a>

## cron

The cron job to invoke `offlineimap` periodically is listed in <cron-jobs>.

Register this cron job, the `cron` will invoke `offlineimap` periodically.


<a id="subsec:gnus"></a>

## gnus

Full configuration in <gnus-conf.el>.

This is the most *frustrating* part. I copied my full configuration here just for your information. However, the essential part that makes it *just work* are detailed as follows.


<a id="orgcaabb94"></a>

### Connect to `dovecot`

```emacs-lisp
(setq gnus-select-method
      '(nnimap "LocalMail"
               (nnimap-address "localhost")
               (nnimap-stream network)
               (nnimap-server-port 143)))
```

Remember that we have a local mail server, `dovecot`, running? The above code connects `gnus` to `dovecot`. Whenever we/gnus want to read mails, `gnus` notifies `dovecot` which retrieves mails from local folder and send it to `gnus`.


<a id="orgd4d4a98"></a>

### Read mails

```emacs-lisp
(setq mail-user-agent 'gnus-user-agent)
(setq read-mail-command 'gnus)
```

The above code notifies `emacs` that we want to use `gnus` to handle mails, since there are other options, e.g., `rmail`.


<a id="orgb613ecf"></a>

### Send mails

```emacs-lisp
(setq send-mail-function 'message-send-mail-with-sendmail)
(setq sendmail-program "msmtp")
```

The above code specifies that we want to use `msmtp` to send mails. Basically when finish editing a mail in `gnus`, you hit <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>, the `gnus` automatically invoke `msmtp` to send mails.

1.  Where to store sent mails

    ```emacs-lisp
    (setq gnus-message-archive-group
          (("Tiger" "nnimap+tiger:Tiger/sent")
           ("Gmail" "nnimap+gmail:Gmail/sent")
           (".*" ,(format-time-string "sent/%Y-%m"))))
    ```

    The above code specifies where the sent mails are stored. Note that `Tiger/sent` is the actual folder where sent mails are stored. Remember that we use `nametrans` to map remote folder to local folder with a different name? If you don't use `nametrans` feature, then this `Tiger/sent` might be `Tiger/Sent Mails`, `Tiger/Sent Items` or some other names.

2.  Email account configuration

    ```emacs-lisp
    (setq gnus-parameters
          '(("Tiger.*"
             (charset . utf-8)
             (posting-style
              (address "zzg0009@auburn.edu")
              (gcc "nnimap+tiger:Tiger/sent")
              (name "Zhitao Gong")
              (signature-file "tiger")
              (organization "Auburn CSSE")))
            ("Gmail.*"
             (charset . utf-8)
             (posting-style
              (address "zhitaao.gong@gmail.com")
              (gcc "nnimap+gmail:Gmail/sent")
              (name "Zhitao Gong")
              (signature-file "gmail")
              (organization "Auburn University")))))
    ```

    This above code configures each account separately, e.g, signatures, charset, etc.


<a id="sec:miscellaneous"></a>

# Miscellaneous

All other configurations are just for personal preference. You could easily find their document online or through `emacs` inline manual.


<a id="sec:conclusion"></a>

# Conclusion

Now it works.

This repo shows a *complete* and *working* solution of `gnus`, another step towards **living in emacs**. It took me years to get used to `emacs` and `gnus`, and I never regret the effort.

## Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" name="fn.1" class="footnum" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> Actually **virtual folders**, since all mails in Gmail are stored in **All Mail** folder, other folder names are just **tags** despite that they are visually displayed as **folders**.

<sup><a id="fn.2" name="fn.2" class="footnum" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup> Not **full** configuration actually, there are lots of configuration files for `dovecot`, most of which, however, work out of the box.
